# GeoPlot
This python code plots the borehole data based on chainage and soil type varying with depth. It takes the data in csv format.
This helps to give an idea about the terrain and also can be used to draw the soil/rock profile by joining the similar terrain using free hand. 

| Borehole|Depth (m)|Chainage (m)|Strata|
|-----:|-----:| -----:|-----:|-----:|
|1|4.0|29.71|Fill|
|1|7.5|29.71|29.61|Clay|
|1|14.25|29.71|Highly Weathered Rock|
